## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or later
- MySQL 8.0 or later (or MariaDB 10.3+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cropper-cso-self-assessment-tool.git
   cd cropper-cso-self-assessment-tool
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup:**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/cropper_cso_assessment"
   
   # Authentication
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secret-key-here"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   
   # Application
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   ```

4. **Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   # If converting from PostgreSQL, you'll need to reset migrations
   # ⚠️ This will delete existing migrations - backup your data first!
   # Option 1: Delete migrations folder and create fresh migration
   rm -rf prisma/migrations
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   
   # Option 2: If starting fresh, just run migrations
   npx prisma migrate dev
   
   # (Optional) Seed the database with sample data
   npm run db:seed
   ```
   
   **Note:** If you're converting from PostgreSQL to MySQL, the existing migrations in `prisma/migrations/` are PostgreSQL-specific and won't work with MySQL. You'll need to create a fresh migration after updating the schema provider to `mysql`.

5. **Create an Admin User:**
   ```bash
   npm run create-admin
   ```

6. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
