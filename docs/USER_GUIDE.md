# CSO Self-Assessment Tool — User Guide

This guide is for **organisations** (Civil Society Organisations) using the IGNITE CSOs Self-Assessment Tool to complete assessments and view their reports.

---

## 1. Getting started

### 1.1 What is the Self-Assessment Tool?

The tool helps your organisation evaluate its practices across four areas:

- **Governance** — leadership, accountability, policies  
- **Financial** — financial management and transparency  
- **Programme** — programme design and delivery  
- **HR** — human resources and capacity  

You answer a set of questions, and the tool calculates scores and suggests areas for improvement.

### 1.2 Accessing the tool

- **Website:** Open the Self-Assessment website (e.g. `https://selfassess.csogo.org`) in your browser.  
- **Home page:** From the home page you can go to **Organization Login** (or the link provided by your administrator) to sign in or register.

---

## 2. Registration and login

### 2.1 Registering your organisation

1. Go to **Organization Login** (e.g. **Self Assessment Login** page).  
2. Click **Register here** (or the equivalent link if you don’t have an account).  
3. Enter:
   - **Organization name**  
   - **Email address** (use a shared or main contact email)  
   - **Password** (choose a strong password and keep it secure)  
4. Submit the form.  
5. Check the inbox for the registration email and **verify your email** using the link in the email. You must verify before you can use the dashboard and assessments.  
6. If you don’t receive the email, check spam/junk, then use **Resend verification** if the option is available on the login page.

### 2.2 Logging in

1. Go to **Organization Login**.  
2. Enter your **email** and **password**.  
3. Click **Login**.  
4. You will be taken to your **Organization dashboard**.

### 2.3 If you forget your password

Contact your system administrator. They can help you regain access (e.g. by resetting your password).

### 2.4 Logging out

Use the **Logout** or **Sign out** option when you see it (e.g. in the dashboard or after opening the menu). This keeps your account secure when someone else may use the same device.

## 3. Your dashboard

After logging in you see the **Organization dashboard**. From here you can:

- **See all your assessments** — both in progress and completed.  
- **Start a new assessment** — use the button/link to start a new assessment (e.g. “Start new assessment” or “New assessment”).  
- **Open an existing assessment** — click an assessment to continue answering or to view its report if it’s completed.  
- **View reports** — for completed assessments you can open the report and download it (see Section 5).

Each assessment usually shows:

- **Status** — e.g. “In progress” or “Completed”.  
- **Date started** (and date completed if applicable).  
- **Actions** — e.g. “Continue”, “View report”, “Download”.

## 4. Completing an assessment

### 4.1 Starting an assessment

1. From the dashboard, click **Start new assessment** (or similar).  
2. You may be asked to give the assessment a name (if so, enter something that helps you identify it later).  
3. You are taken to the first section of the assessment.

### 4.2 How the assessment is structured

- The assessment is split into **sections** (e.g. Governance, Financial, Programme, HR).  
- Each section has several **questions**.  
- You move through sections in order; within a section you answer each question.  
- Your answers are **saved as you go**, so you can leave and come back later.

### 4.3 Types of questions

You may see:

- **Single choice** — choose one option (e.g. radio buttons).  
- **Multiple choice** — choose one or more options (e.g. checkboxes).  
- **Likert scale** — choose a point on a scale (e.g. 1–5 or “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree”).  
- **Yes/No** — choose Yes or No.  
- **Text** — type a short or longer answer in a text box.

Some questions may be **required** (marked as such). Fill those in to complete the section or assessment.

### 4.4 Tips for answering

- Read each question and any description carefully.  
- Answer as honestly as possible; the report is for your own improvement.  
- You can go **back** to change answers before you submit.  
- If you are unsure, you can leave and return later — progress is saved.

### 4.5 Submitting the assessment

- When you have answered all required questions, you will see an option to **Submit** or **Complete** the assessment.  
- After you submit, the assessment status becomes **Completed** and the **report** is generated.  
- You are then able to **view** and **download** the report (see Section 5).

### 4.6 Shareable links (if enabled)

If your administrator has enabled shareable links, you may get a **link** to an assessment (e.g. to share with a colleague). Anyone with the link can open that assessment; they may be able to view or complete it depending on how it’s set up. Keep the link private if the content is confidential.

## 5. Viewing and using your report

### 5.1 Opening the report

- From the dashboard, click the **View report** (or similar) action for a **completed** assessment.  
- Or open the assessment and you will be redirected to its report page when it’s completed.

### 5.2 What the report contains

The report typically includes:

- **Scores by section** — e.g. Governance, Financial, Programme, HR (often as percentages).  
- **Overall score** — a single percentage or level for the whole assessment.  
- **Overall level** — e.g. “Emerging Organization”, “Strong Foundation”, or “Leading Organization”, based on your overall score.  
- **Suggestions for improvement** — short recommendations based on your answers and scores. Suggestions may be marked by **priority** (e.g. Critical, High, Medium, Low) and by **category** (e.g. section or theme).

### 5.3 Downloading the report

- On the report page, use the **Download PDF** (or similar) button to save the report as a PDF file.  
- You may also see an option to **Download Excel** for data.  
- Store downloaded files securely and share only with people who are allowed to see them.

### 5.4 Using the suggestions

- Read suggestions by priority (e.g. start with Critical and High).  
- Use them to plan training, policy updates, or process changes.  
- You can run another assessment later to see how scores and suggestions change over time.

## 6. Organisation reports page

If your site has an **Organization reports** (or “Reports”) page:

- It lists **reports** for your organisation.  
- From there you can open any completed assessment’s report and download it, same as from the dashboard.

---

## 7. Getting help

- **Technical issues** (e.g. can’t log in, link doesn’t work, email not received): contact your **system administrator** or the support contact provided by the organisation that runs the tool.  
- **Questions about the assessment content** (e.g. what a question means, how to interpret the report): contact the programme or assessment owner (e.g. IGNITE CSOs or the partner who gave you access).  
- **About the tool and programme:** check the **About** and **Legal** (Terms, Privacy, Acceptable Use) pages on the website if available.
